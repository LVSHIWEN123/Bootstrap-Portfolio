          Wu was born in Berkeley, California and raised in Orinda, California.
          His parents, Diana, a college professor and George Wu, a retired
          engineer,[4] are natives of Shanghai, China. His father immigrated to
          the United States after the communist revolution in China in 1949 and
          met his mother in New York, where she was a student. After marrying,
          they settled in California.[5] Wu has two older sisters, Greta and
          Gloria and an older brother who died when he was two.[4][6] Wu
          developed an interest in martial arts when he saw Jet Li in The
          Shaolin Temple and Donnie Yen in Iron Monkey,[2] and consequently
          began studying wushu at age 11.[7] His childhood role model was Jackie
          Chan,[5] a man who now considers Wu "like a son."[8] Wu attended the
          Head-Royce School in Oakland, California[9] and later majored in
          architecture at the University of Oregon. While there, he founded the
          University of Oregon Wushu Club in 1994 and served as the team's first
          coach.[10] During this time, Wu also took film classes and frequented
          local theaters, and came to enjoy the works of filmmakers like Akira
          Kurosawa and Luc Besson, whom he describes as "men of vision.
